%% Site and topology characteristics
% This set of options define the turbine locations, freestream wind speed
% and wind direction, and the (default) turbine control settings.

%% Atmosphere characteristics
% Herein we define whether we have a fully uniform inflow ('uniform'),
% where we neglect the ground shear layer. Alternatively, we can include
% the ground shear layer by assuming a logarithmic inflow profile in
% z-direction, using the option 'boundary'.
